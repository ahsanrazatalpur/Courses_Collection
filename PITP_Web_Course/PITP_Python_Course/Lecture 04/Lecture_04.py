# Function and scope 

# Def :  Function are reusable block of code that perform specific task
# It organaize code into logical section
# promote code reusablity and reduce duplication 

# Why Function
# Avoid repetation of code
# make program easier to read and maintain
# break complex problem into smaller pieces


# Defination
# us e def keyword  followed by function name and parentheses
# code block is intented 

# Syntax :
# def function_name():
# code to execute


# Simple function

# def greet():
#     print("hi, There How are you Mr!")
# greet()

# def greet(name):
#     print("Hi,",name,"How are you ")
# greet("Ahsan")

# def sum(a,b):
#     result = a + b
#     print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {result}")
# sum(2,3)


# def ab(a,b):
#     sum = a + b
#     diff = a - b
#     return sum, diff
# result = ab(2,5)
# print(result)

# Defalt parameter 
# Paarmeter can be have default values
# make parameter optional


# def greet(name = "Ahsan Raza"):
#     print(f"Hello, {name} How are you")
# greet()
# greet("Ali Raza")


# Keyword Arguement
# Pass arguement  by parameter name 
# order doesnot matter while using keyword

# def name(name,age,height):
#     print(f"My name is {name} and my age is {age} and my height is {height}")
# name("Ahsan", 20,5.5)
# name(age = 20 ,name = "Ahsan",height = 5.6)



# Local Variables
# variable defined inside a function
# only accesable with that function

# def locvar():
#     local_variables = "Hi there"
#     print(local_variables)
# locvar()


# Global  hjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj

# name = "Elon Musk"
# def Global():
#     print(name)
# name()
# print(name)
