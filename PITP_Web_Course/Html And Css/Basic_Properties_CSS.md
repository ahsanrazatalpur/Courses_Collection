Display  :flex;
  
  mean make this container flex so contetnt inside its container get that property not the container ityself 

  eg : i make container flex 
  i have 3 box in container
  so those three boxes become flex not contaienr itself understand 


if i have to amke the most parent container to make iut centre so i have to give display flex justifuy content center align item center to the bofy tag because it is the parent on container tag


  if you have to amke any contaienr center so make like this
  1. margin: 200px auto;   the first 200 mean vertical 200 depend on container size you can change to amke item center  and then horizental auto it become center the any elemet



  margin :  to make distance from outside of elemnt 
  like 3 box in continer so amke container margin 10  to parent so its child move 10px horizentaly
