There are 5 types of position in CSS
 1. Static(By default) : It means the element cannot be moved using top, right, bottom, or left.
    It is used to reset an element or confirm that no other positioning is applied.

2. Relative:(move with itself) It allows moving the element using top, right, bottom, or left, but it does not affect 
    the layout — the element still keeps its original space in the page flow.

3. Absolute :(change pisition to relevant to its parent only whose who have position else no if no position to ancecot
then find most top parent) It removes the element from the normal layout flow and positions it relative to its nearest 
   positioned ancestor (or the viewport if none). It can be moved freely using top, right, bottom, left.

4. Fixed :It removes the element from the normal layout flow and positions it relative to the viewport, 
    so it stays in the same place even when scrolling. It can be moved using top, right, bottom, left. 

5. Sticky :It behaves like relative until you scroll past a certain point, then it becomes fixed (sticks) at
    a defined position using top, right, bottom, or left.
