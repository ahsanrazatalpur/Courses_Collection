***                            What is a computer program ?                          ***
A simple analogy : A recipe

A recipe is a set of instruction for a person 
A program is a set of instruction for a computer


Think 
You are a chef and recipe is a program and the kitchen is the tool for computer

The computer follows your instruction exactly , without getting tired or making assumptions






***                          What is a programing language                                  ***

How do we talk to computer ?

Computer only undersatnd binary 1s and 0s 

This is like trying to talk to someone using on off clicks

It is very difficult to human

A programming language is a translator 

It let us write instruction in language closer to english 

A special program called (interpreter and compiler) that translate it into 0s and 1s for the computer 




***                                 Why we are learning Python                                   ***

Imagine many programming language 
some are :
          complex
          simple
    
Python is known for being :
  1. Readable (easy syntax)
  2. Simple  (easy to understand closer to english)
  3. Friendly (clear error message and huge community for help)
